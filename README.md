Myself, Vivek Muthyala. And i am a first year B-Tech undergrad at Amrita vishwa vidyapeetham, at Amritapur campus.
And I am currently studying in semester-2 from cyber security depertment. I am a beginner-level coder, so my preferred programming language is Python.
My hobbies are playiioup projects and group activities.

# why should we choose you

I strongly belive in consistency and Discipline.I deeply value my commitment that i made towards, the club. Throughout my journey of completing the tasts during the Praveshan. I have given my best in doing it and am happy to say that i did it. I  am very eager to learn more and more about the club and the programms that we are going to do as a team and am very eager to learn and adapt new things which am doing to learn from the club. I belive that  i give my best for the club. And i am sure that i will definitely make you guys proud.
And am very confident in my ability to prove what i am and to contribute my best to the club. And am fully prepared to dedicate all my time and efforts to the club.

# How do you intend to contribute back to the club

I am very focused to actively participate in descuusions, events, and activities that are hosted by the club. I will defenitely retain my commetment that i made to the club you can belive me on my commetment. I belive on my efforts and hard work that i do to give my best for the club. I'm committed to putting in the hard work and dedicating the necessary hours because I believe in the principle that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction—so the universe rewards effort. My passion for technology drives me to participate in various competitions, and I see these opportunities as a way to represent and promote the club, AM@FOSS. 

# What are your fields of interest, and how do you plan on working on them?

My field of interest lies in both electronics and computers, which explains why I ended up in my BTech branch.when it comes to computers, my interest lies in Python,web development,and blockchain technology.I want to deep dive into blockchain technology and learn more about it. I’m also interested in integrating blockchain with FOSS projects. I don’t know how appealing this seems because I don’t know much about blockchain yet, but I am eager to grasp its knowledge. Additionally, my field of interest includes joining the AM@FOSS club because it’s the only club I want to join so badly. On a different note, I also want to achieve a better physique over time and am committed to working for it.

# What are your thoughts and feedback on the Praveshan Selection Process?

The tasks have been truly amazing, and I've learned so much from each one. It's been a long journey filled with challenges, but I've managed to overcome them over time. I'm really grateful to my mentors for their continuous guidance. When I first saw the tasks, I never thought I would make it this far. Although I hope to be selected, I won't be completely disheartened if it doesn’t go that way, as the lessons I've learned throughout the process are incredibly valuable. I do feel a bit sad that I wasn't able to complete all ten tasks, despite giving my very best effort on each one.
